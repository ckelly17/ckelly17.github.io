I enjoy creating dashboards on topics that interest me. Most of them are hosted on my [Tableau Public site](https://public.tableau.com/profile/ckelly2528#!/), but you can find them below as well. Sometimes you'll find me highlighting them on Twitter.


### COVID-19 Daily Statistics
This dashboard uses data from the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to display trends in COVID-19 cases, deaths, hospitalizations and tests. Click [here](covid_dashboard.html) to view the dashboard.

### 2020 Election: Early Vote Tracker
This dashboard used data from Michael McDonald and the [U.S. Elections Project](https://electproject.github.io/Early-Vote-2020G/index.html), tracking vote-by-mail and early voting trends in the 2020 general election. Michael's site only provided a snapshot of early voting trends, so I cached the daily data to show trends over the course of the full run-up to the election. Click [here](https://public.tableau.com/profile/ckelly2528#!/vizhome/VotebyMailTracker/Dashboard1) to view the dashboard.
