I enjoy creating dashboards on topics that interest me. Most of them are hosted on my Tableau Public site, but you can find them below as well. Sometimes you'll find me putting them out on Twitter.

### COVID-19 Daily Statistics
This dashboard uses data from the [New York Times](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data) and [The COVID Tracking Project](https://covidtracking.com/) to display trends in COVID-19 cases, deaths, hospitalizations and tests. Click [here](covid_dashboard.html) to view the dashboard.

### 2020 Election: Presidential Polling Averages
This dashboard used data from [FiveThirtyEight](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/polls) to compare presidential polling averages at similar points in the 2016 and 2020 presidential elections. Click [here](polling_dashboard.html) to view the dashboard.

### 2020 Election: Early Vote Tracker
This dashboard used data from Michael McDonald and the [U.S. Elections Project](https://electproject.github.io/Early-Vote-2020G/index.html), tracking vote-by-mail and early voting trends in the 2020 general election. Michael's site only provided a snapshot of early voting trends, so I cached the daily data to show trends over the course of the full run-up to the election. Click [here](https://public.tableau.com/profile/ckelly2528#!/vizhome/VotebyMailTracker/Dashboard1) to view the dashboard.
