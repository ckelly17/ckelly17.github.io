This dashboard uses data from the [New York Times](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data) and [The COVID Tracking Project](https://covidtracking.com/) to display trends in COVID-19 cases, deaths, hospitalizations and tests. The code that builds the dataset can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/ckelly17/Coronavirus-Dashboard). If you want to see the four-panel national overview graphics from my Twitter, click [here](https://public.tableau.com/profile/ckelly2528#!/vizhome/COVIDDashboard-Public/FED_TWEET).

**Note**: Beginning March 7, 2021, The COVID Tracking Project will stop publishing data. At that point, the dashboard will switch over to use data from federal sources (CDC and HHS). The old version will still be available through my Tableau Public page [here](https://public.tableau.com/profile/ckelly2528#!/vizhome/CoronavirusDashboard-CTPdeprecated/NationalOverview).
